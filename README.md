A Reinfocement Learning Omnidirectional robot to transport hospital materials.

## Description

This project represents my MSc Thesis, focused on developing an Omnidirectional robot designed to efficiently transport hospital materials. The robot incorporates advanced reinforcement learning techniques to dynamically adapt and navigate through diverse environments, while also learning to perform new tasks through trial and error. This project is a collaboration between Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico and the Champalimaud Foundation.

### Features

- Omnidirectional mobility for enhanced maneuverability within hospital settings.
- Adaptive learning through reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize navigation efficiency.
- Seamless integration with hospital logistics systems to streamline material transport.
